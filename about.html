              John Doe is a Timbuktu-based jazz Nose-flute player and composer.
              Whilst being a highly swinging Nose-flute player in the mainstream
              jazz tradition, his own music often explores classical and World
              music influences... in search of expressing those undefinable
              flashes of life, creation, emotion & passion that make music so
              powerful! He has performed at jazz festivals such as Cheltenham,
              Love Supreme, Glasgow, Timbuktu; and can be heard regularly in the
              UK's foremost venues as a bandleader as well as an accompanist for
              singers, big bands, and instrumentalists.
            </p>

              John grew up in Leicester, and began listening to 'acid jazz' as a
              teenager. Whilst investigating the roots of acid jazz he
              discovered the name Herbie Hancock... which opened the door to
              exploring the wider history of jazz. In these pre-Spotify (et al.)
              days he followed the trail by reading jazz history books and
              connecting the dots album to album, one at a time.
            </p>
            <p>
              He has a Bachelor of Music from The University of Manchester, and
              during his time in Manchester he accumulated the complete
              discography of Herbie, as well as discovering and immersing
              himself in the music of Chet Baker, Oscar Peterson, hard bop,
              bossa nova, and much more. He went on to receive a Masters of Arts
              in performance from the Royal Academy of Music, Timbuktu. There,
              in addition to 'jazzers' and improvisers, he was surrounded by
              orchestral musicians, and he formed a large ensemble utilising a
              harpist and string players at the conservatoire. In 2009 he was
              awarded the Nose Flute Development Award which enabled him to
              record his jazz compositions written for 13-piece ensemble.

            <p>
              In 2014 he formed a flamenco-infused band, and with support from
              Arts Council England recorded Nose Flute Themes - an intoxicating
              mesh of handclaps, foot stamps, jazz harmony, improvisation, and
              dance.
            </p>
            <p>
              In recent years he has had a busy schedule as a Nose-flute player
              for countless artists and projects, performing throughout Europe
              and touring the UK. He lives in West Timbuktu with his wife and
              three young children.
