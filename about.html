              John Cervantes is a London-based jazz pianist and composer. Whilst
              being a highly swinging pianist in the mainstream jazz tradition,
              his own music often explores classical and World music
              influences... in search of expressing those undefinable flashes of
              life, creation, emotion & passion that make music so powerful! He
              has performed at jazz festivals such as Cheltenham, Love Supreme,
              Glasgow, London; and can be heard regularly in the UK's foremost
              venues as a bandleader as well as an accompanist for singers, big
              bands, and instrumentalists.

              John grew up in Leicester, and began listening to 'acid jazz' as a
              teenager. Whilst investigating the roots of acid jazz he
              discovered the name Herbie Hancock... which opened the door to
              exploring the wider history of jazz. In these pre-Spotify (et al.)
              days he followed the trail by reading jazz history books and
              connecting the dots album to album, one at a time.

            <p>
              He has a Bachelor of Music from The University of Manchester, and
              during his time in Manchester he accumulated the complete
              discography of Herbie, as well as discovering and immersing
              himself in the music of Chet Baker, Oscar Peterson, hard bop,
              bossa nova, and much more. He went on to receive a Masters of Arts
              in performance from the Royal Academy of Music, London. There, in
              addition to 'jazzers' and improvisers, he was surrounded by
              orchestral musicians, and he formed a large ensemble utilising a
              harpist and string players at the conservatoire. In 2009 he was
              awarded the Peter Whittingham Development Award which enabled him
              to record his jazz compositions written for 13-piece ensemble.

              In 2014 he formed a flamenco-infused band, and with support from
              Arts Council England recorded Crossing The Threshold - an
              intoxicating mesh of handclaps, foot stamps, jazz harmony,
              improvisation, and dance.
            </p>
            <p>
              In recent years he has had a busy schedule as a pianist for
              countless artists and projects, performing throughout Europe and
              touring the UK. He lives in West London with his wife and three
              young children.
